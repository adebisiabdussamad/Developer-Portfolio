            <h3>A co-founder at one of the world's largest communities.</h3>
            <p>
              The combined experience I have working at the top Fortune 500 companies has allowed me to developer a
              skillset that helps me in not just development, but in every aspect of any
              business.
            </p>
            <p>
              I'm proud to announce that I am now working at one of the world's largest communities teaching young minds
              about how to <em>sell</em> yourself as a developer and open them to a whole new
              world of opportunities.
            </p>

          <li class="para">
            <p>As a developer, you have everything available to you and all that's holding you back is yourself.</p>
            <p>
              A quote I live bt perfectly illustrates what I mean.
            </p>
            <p>
              "How big would you dream, if you knew you wouldn't fail?" You've already gone through the hardest parts
              being a developer, it's time to elevate your skills and become a leader in something you're
              <em>passionate</em> about.
            </p>
            <p>
              I'm happy to chat over coffee some time about how I can help your company.
